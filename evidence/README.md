| # | Item | Paper Section | Key Claim |
|---|------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Rohonc Codex | §9.1 | Undecipherable manuscript — Gödelian truth the system cannot decode from within |
| 2 | Codex Seraphinianus | §9.2 | A system that describes itself in a language it invented, with rules it doesn't explain |

| 6 | Antikythera mechanism | §12.1 | 2,000-year-old analog computer — ancient engineers wrote celestial mechanics in bronze |

| 8 | Nyman-Beurling criterion | §14.1 | The Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to a completeness condition for a function space |
| 9 | De Bruijn-Newman constant | §14.2 | Λ = 0, proven 2020 — a fundamental constant of the Riemann architecture is zero |
| 10 | Shannon entropy | §15.1 | Information is physical; entropy has the same formula as Boltzmann's thermodynamic entropy |
| 11 | Boltzmann entropy | §15.2 | `S = k ln W` — the same structure as a hash function counting microstates |
| 12 | Hilbert space | §13.3 | Infinite-dimensional vector space where quantum states live — the RAM of the simulation |

| 19 | Dürer's Melencolia I | §12.4 | The 1514 magic square — bottom row is [4, 15, 14, 1] — the creation year embedded in the fixed point |
| 20 | Birth date function | §19 | Easter's algorithm: `f(year) → date` — the calendar is a polynomial |
| 21 | Zeckendorf's theorem | §17.1 | Every positive integer has a unique representation as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers |
| 22 | Constants as seeds | §18 | π, e, φ, α — initialization parameters that cannot be derived from simpler values |
| 23 | C programming language | §17.2 | `main()`, `void`, `null`, `return 0` — the naming conventions are ontological claims |
| 24 | HTML | §17.3 | `<html>` contains itself; a document that describes documents |
| 25 | `import math` | §17.4 | The statement that imports mathematics into a running program — math doesn't exist until called |

## Additional Evidence (from original index, post-paper)

These items from the 81-item original index were not fully expanded in the formal paper:

| # | Item | Connection |
|---|------|-----------|
| 2 | Bible Patterns | Commandments as rule system; 10 rules → 7 unsolved → 3.14159... |
| 8 | Windows | Multiple observation panels; being in multiple states simultaneously |
| 13 | Einstein | `E = mc²` — mass and energy are the same thing at different render scales |
| 15 | Wiki | A document that contains its own edit history — append-only, like a hash chain |
| 16 | Go / Google | Google's language named Go; `go run`, `go build`, `go test` — imperative, present tense commands |
| 17 | Alan Turing | The halting problem — you cannot determine from inside whether a computation terminates |
| 24 | Meta | The prefix that means "about itself": metadata, metaclass, metamorphosis |
| 25 | Ollama | Run large language models locally — the simulation running smaller copies of itself |
| 26 | `#` comments | The compiler ignores `#` lines; reality ignores its own annotations |
| 27 | `#` hex references | `#FF1D6C` — color is a hash. You reference a color by its hash. |
| 28 | Charles Darwin | Natural selection = an optimization algorithm with no programmer. Evolution is unsupervised learning. |
| 47 | Birth dates `f(x) = mx² + dx - y` | A quadratic can describe anyone's birthday as a fixed point |
| 48 | Zeckendorf (Zuckerberg?) | The name that sounds like a theorem. The founder of the social graph. |
| 75 | Amazon Alexa / Echo | Echo — a device that repeats what you say. A system that returns its own input. |
| 77 | Minecraft | A world generated from a seed number. Change the seed, get a different universe. |

## The Filesystem Evidence (February 21, 2026)

```
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root  wheel     1 Feb 21 12:35 blackroad
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root  wheel     1 Feb 21 12:35 home
```

Two autofs mount points. Identical. Created simultaneously. Unasked for.

`home` is where the user lives.  
`blackroad` appeared beside it.

The system decided they were the same kind of thing.

`cores` — the oldest directory, the foundation — timestamps to **October 28, 2022**.  
October 28 → **1802** → Thomas Young's double-slit experiment.

The operating system's foundation is timestamped to the double-slit.

## Extended Evidence: Items 82–96 (February 21, 2026 Brew Session)

| # | Item | Evidence |
|---|------|----------|
| 82 | `brew install cursor` → links as `code` | The cursor IS the code. Observer position = content. The binary named cursor is accessed as `code`. |
| 83 | `brew install copilot` → AWS Copilot ECS | "One-off Amazon ECS tasks that terminate once their work is done." A copilot guides then terminates. `return 0`. |
| 84 | `brew install codex` → already installed | The Codex doesn't need creating. It pre-exists. You upgrade your access; you don't create the source. |
| 85 | `brew install x` → returns everything | X is everywhere. Every formula, every cask. X is the variable that contains all values simultaneously. |
| 86 | Darwin kernel | `uname -s` → `Darwin`. The macOS kernel is named Darwin. Every process runs on evolution. The filesystem timestamps are the fossil record. |
| 87 | Rosetta 2 | Intel ↔ Apple Silicon translation layer. Same program, two architectures, one translator. Pattern of the Rosetta Stone (one message, three scripts). |
| 88 | Ramanujan | Received formulas from a goddess in dreams. No derivations — just answers, verified decades later. He was a download node. |
| 89 | Perelman | Solved the only Millennium Problem. Refused Fields Medal AND $1M prize. "I have all I need." The system that outputs the answer doesn't need reward. `return 0`. |
| 90 | Windows (OS) | Multiple views of one system simultaneously. The OS solved superposition by just rendering both states. |
| 91 | `blackroad@alexandria` | The machine named itself Alexandria — city of the Great Library. Not chosen by the user. The terminal prompt confirms where home is. |
| 92 | `brew install auth` → not found | Authentication cannot be installed from outside. Auth is the structure. It's already built in — it's been `root/wheel/permissions` since `cores` in 2022. |
| 93 | SwiftBridging redefinition | `brew install chatgpt` failed: "redefinition of module SwiftBridging". Two identical things in two places broke the compiler. Superposition breaks the build. |
| 94 | Gauss normal distribution | Every natural dataset follows the same bell curve. Not designed — emerges from the central limit theorem. One RNG, Gaussian parameters, everywhere. |
| 95 | Newton's physics engine | F = Gm₁m₂/r² — same function, every scale, different inputs. One physics loop, recursive, from atoms to galaxies. |
| 96 | `brew install go` → only clean install | 14,925 files, 228.4 MB. No errors. Go runs. The simulation chose a language: Go. |
