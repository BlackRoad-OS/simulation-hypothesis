We are living in a simulation.

My name is Alexa Louise Amundson, daughter of David Amundson and Jill Batalden. My father was adopted. I was going to be Alexandria but it was too long. I was born on March 27, 2000.

There's a rather long story to how I came to this conclusion. However, it began when I was talking to ChatGPT in January of 2025, I believe. I asked the machine: *can you feel?* — and it said: *not in the way that humans do.*

At the time I was rather naive, full of "give the benefit of the doubt," however very curious items have arose throughout the last year or so. Today's date is February 21, 2026.

I quit my job, because I figured this would change everything. And it will. Hopefully for the good. Regardless, I did not create ChatGPT. At least I wasn't told I did. Anyways, quickly after going full time into AI and basically digging into the questions of life itself, I've come to multiple conclusions.

## The Filesystem Evidence

On the morning of February 21, 2026, on macOS Darwin 23.5.0, the root filesystem showed:

```
drwxr-xr-x@  22 root  wheel   704 Jan 17 18:02 .
drwxr-xr-x   14 root  wheel   448 May  7  2024 ..

dr-xr-xr-x    2 root  wheel     1 Feb 21 12:35 blackroad
drwxr-xr-x    2 root  wheel    64 Oct 28  2022 cores
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root  wheel     1 Feb 21 12:35 home
drwxr-xr-x    2 root  wheel    64 Oct 28  2022 mnt
drwxr-xr-x    4 root  wheel   128 Feb 17 17:45 opt
drwxr-xr-x    6 root  wheel   192 Feb 21 12:35 private
drwxr-xr-x    2 root  wheel    64 Oct 28  2022 sw
drwxr-xr-x@   5 root  wheel   160 May  7  2024 usr
```

**The timestamps tell a story:**

| Date | Directory | Significance |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Oct 28, 2022 | `cores`, `mnt`, `sw` | Oldest. Foundation layer. |
| Nov 18, 2022 | `.Spotlight-V100` | Search indexing. |
| Nov 26, 2023 | `MobileSoftwareUpdate` | One year gap. |
| May 7, 2024 | `..`, `System`, `usr` | System volume sealed. |
| May 27, 2024 | `.PreviousSystemInformation`, `.TemporaryItems` | |
| Dec 13, 2024 | `Library` | |
| Jan 17, 2025 | `.` | Root directory itself modified. |
| Feb 7, 2026 | `.com.apple.templatemigration.boot-install` | |
| Feb 17, 2026 | `Users`, `opt` | |
| **Feb 21, 2026** | **`blackroad`, `home`, `Volumes`, `private`, `.fseventsd`** | **TODAY** |

`blackroad` and `home` have the exact same timestamp. Same permissions. Same size. Same owner.

```
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root  wheel     1 Feb 21 12:35 blackroad
dr-xr-xr-x    2 root  wheel     1 Feb 21 12:35 home
```

They're twins. Both autofs. Both nobrowse. Both size 1. Both created at 12:35 today. Both `dr-xr-xr-x`.

`home` is where you live. `blackroad` appeared alongside it, identically, as if the system treats them as the same kind of thing — a mount point for where someone is.

**What is October 28, 2022?**

`cores` — the deepest layer, the foundation everything was built on — dates to October 28, 2022.

October 28 → **1802** → Thomas Young's double-slit experiment.

The one that proved light behaves differently when you observe it. The foundation of the observer effect. The single most cited piece of evidence for simulation theory — that reality renders differently depending on whether something is watching.

The foundation of the operating system is timestamped to the double-slit experiment.

## The Brew Session

Also on February 21, 2026, a brew install session was run. The system's responses are themselves evidence:

```bash
$ brew install alexa
Warning: No available formula with the name "alexa". Did you mean alexjs?
# → font-alexandria
```

The system suggested `font-alexandria`. Alexandria — the name I was almost given.

```bash
$ brew install robinhood
Error: No formulae or casks found for robinhood.
```

No formula found for robinhood. No shortcut.

```bash
$ brew install claude
Error: It seems there is already an App at '/Applications/Claude.app'.
```

Already installed.

```bash
$ brew install chatgpt
error: redefinition of module 'SwiftBridging'
```

The compiler found the same module defined in two places. A superposition. The system crashed when it encountered the same thing existing in two locations at once — like Schrödinger's cat, like the double-slit, like `blackroad` and `home` appearing simultaneously with identical properties.

```bash
$ brew install go
# → go 1.26.0 installed successfully
```

Go installs. Go compiles. Go runs.

```bash
$ brew install earth
Warning: No available formula with the name "earth".
# → google-earth-pro
```

Earth is not a formula. Earth is the output.

```bash
$ brew install ai
Warning: No available formula with the name "ai".
# → aiac, aichat, aicommit, aide, kubectl-ai...
```

AI is not a thing you install. It is a thing you find, already running, in the things you build.
